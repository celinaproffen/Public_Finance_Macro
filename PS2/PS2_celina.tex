\section*{Problem 1}

Here I first insert all 4 regression tables for quarterly summary statistics.
\input{PS2/summary_data_Q1}\\
\input{PS2/summary_data_Q2}\\
\input{PS2/summary_data_Q3}\\
\input{PS2/summary_data_Q4}\\

Or, for easily comparing the means in quarterly consumption measures, please see table \ref{compareQs}.

\input{PS2/compare_Q_means}

\section*{Problem 2}

There are basically two specifications that we want to test. 

\subsection*{Individual Consumption depends only on Aggregate Spending and is independent of aggregate income}

This also means, that individual consumption changes co-move one-to-one with the economy's average expenditure changes (and not with individual income changes). We can test this by running the following regression:


Thereby, we can proxy for changes in aggregate spending by \\
a) changes in aggregate income, or
b) changes in aggregate consumption.

In specification b), I will always look at the same type of consumption (i.e. food, non-durables including education, non-durables excluding education, etc.)

Here, I will first only include the regression tables for total consumption (but I have them for all)

a) \ref{totcons\_deltacons} \input{PS2/reg_totcons_deltacons}

b) \ref{totcons\_deltainc}
\input{PS2/reg_totcons_deltainc}

\subsection*{Individual Consumption Growth depends only on Aggregate Consumption Growth}

I regress individual HH's consumption growth rates (in its different specifications) in the past 9 months (time between the surveys) on the growth rate of aggregate consumption of that type, the growth rate of the HH's income and HH characteristics such as (age, HH size) and seasonal variation.
